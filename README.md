## Firefox is better...

A list of over 100 reasons Firefox is more powerful, flexible and customisable 💯

| Feature | Firefox | Chrome | Edge | Comment |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Picture-in-Picture button | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | In Chrome, you have to right click the video twice to reveal the Picture-in-Picture option |  
| Picture-in-Picture: Subtitles support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | |
| Picture-in-Picture: full controls | ✅ |❌| ❌ | Including a progress bar, mute, fullscreen and -5/+5 sec jump. Chrome/Edge only have Play/Pause |
| Picture-in-Picture: no limits on window size | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Edge has a limit on the PiP window size  |
| Picture-in-Picture: supported on most sites | ✅ |❌ | ❌ | Firefox supports Dailymotion, TikTok and Twitter, among many others. Edge and Chrome lack this. |
| Picture-in-Picture: multi PiP windows | ✅ |❌| ❌ |  |
| Picture-in-Picture: use arrow keys to jump forward/back | ✅ |❌| ❌ |  |
| Video player: Volume controls | ✅ | ✅  | ❌|  |
| Video player: Speed control | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Video player: Take Snapshot feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Multi Account-Containers | ✅| ❌| ❌| Lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple accounts. While some addons/hacks/workarounds exist for Edge/Chrome, none work as well as Firefox's! | 
| Ctrl+Tab MRU tab switcher | ✅ |❌| ❌ | Allows you to use Ctrl+Tab to switch tabs in most recently used order (MRU) like Alt+Tab/Cmd+Tab in Windows/Mac. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn can still be used to go next/previous tab too!  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/168515810-84a75560-62ac-441e-be99-b539fe0966c2.png) |
| Reader View | ✅ | ⚠ |✅| Chrome's Reader feature needs to be enabled first under chrome://flags, and requires a re-launch of the browser to become available |
| Reader View: Read aloud/Text To Speech feature | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | |
| Block videos from playing automatically | ✅ | ❔| ❔ | Firefox blocks many videos from auto-playing by default |
| uBlock Origin: works best | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox |
| LocalCDN: works best |✅ | ❌| ❌ | "Chromium unfortunately doesn't support all the cool features of LocalCDN." |
| Vertical tabs/Tree Style Tabs | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Edge has this built-in, but without the heirachy or customisability of Tree Style Tabs. Half a point to Edge! | 
| Close push notifications with middle-click | ✅ | ? | ❌| Edge's notifications can only be closed by clicking the small X  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Fingerprinters | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Cryptominers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Cross-Site Tracking Cookies | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Tracking Content | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Note - the Do Not Track feature is turned off by default, except for Private Windows.  |
| Tracking Protection: View stats | ✅|❌|✅ | View short and long-term blocked trackers, fingerprinters and cryptominers at about:protections. I can't find a way to view stats in Chrome |
| Tracking protection: View stats since install date | ✅|❌|❌ | This is a small thing, but Firefox shows "number of trackers blocked since <date>" |
| Developer Tools: Open immediately using F12 key | ✅ | ✅ | ❌| Edge has a welcome screen prompt - I find this annoying but others may like it. |
| Developer Tools: pop out into a separate window _easily_ | ✅ | ✅| ✅|  |
| Developer Tools inspector: Search bar | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | Edge is awkward about searching HTML |
| Developer Tools: show the Domain column in Network tab by default  | ✅|❌|❌| What are they trying to hide?? |
| Developer Tools: easily select multiple types, eg Font and Img | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | You have to hold down Ctrl+Click in Chrome/Edge (discovered that by accident) |
| Developer Tools: auto size column with double click |  ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  |
| Developer Tools: live variable testing | ✅ | ? | ❌ | Firefox lets you mess with variables in the console live, without having to execute any commands! |
| Developer Tools: Edit and Resend | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | | 
| Developer Tools: Preview images | ✅ |✅ | ❌ | Hover to preview images. Chrome actually goes one better though, images are shown as thumbnails which is nice! |
| Granular customisation/configurability | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox's about:config allows users to change hundreds of settings unlike edge/chrome's about:flags |
| Context Menu: Access keys  | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox underlines access keys in context menus like all apps should. |
| SSL/certificate/HTTPS can be permanently excepted/stored |✅ | ❌| ❌ | On Chrome/Edge you have to choose Advanced, then Proceed each time.|
| Certificates: doesn't rely on OS's cert store |✅ |❌|❌| Firefox manages its own certificates, separate from the OS. This means it doesn't rely on OS patches/updates if certs need updating/revoking |
| Copy hyperlinked text using Alt + Left click | ✅ | ? | ❌| In Edge, the only way to do this is by Inspecting Element |
| Circumvent sites that block right-clicking | ✅ | ❌|❌| In Firefox, you can Shift + Right Click on sites that prevent you from right clicking |
| Show hyperlink URL immediately on hover | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | You have to hover over the link for a few seconds in Edge|
| Simple homepage config | ✅ | ✅ | ❌| Seriously Edge, how do I turn off all the junk?? |
| Keyboard shortcut for Dev Tools: Network tab | ✅ | ❔| ❔| Hit Ctrl+Shift+E to open dev tools: Network tab in Firefox |
| Send tab to other device function | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to use your own sync server | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Apparently it's possible! No, I haven't tried it. MS and Google are your only options with Chrome and Edge |
| Extensive customisation (eg userChrome.css) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Multiple dictionary (spell checker) support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Protected from spell-jacking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Chrome and Edge use an online spell checker, which sends your data to their servers https://geekermag.com/stop-chrome-edge-spell-check-leaking-passwords/ |
| Extensions/Add-ons on mobile | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Currently mainstream Firefox on Android supports a limited number of addons, but Firefox Nightly does not have this restriction. As for Firefox on iOS - blame Apple |
| Easy on RAM/CPU* | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | I see way too many complaints about RAM/CPU utilisation by Chrome. I'll give a point here to Edge though as it snoozes tabs and seems to handle many tabs well |
| Allows blocking WebRequests in Manifest v3 | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | One of the most controversial changes of Chrome’s MV3 approach is the removal of blocking WebRequest, which provides a level of power and flexibility that is critical to enabling advanced privacy and content blocking features. Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome’s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.|
| Android: Background media play | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Firefox allows you to listen to a videos in the background or with the screen off! | 
| Screenshot tool built in | ✅ | ❌ | ✅| Really shouldn't need this, but on Windows the Snipping Tool and Snip & Sketch apps suck |
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | While Chromium (the engine Chrome and Edge are based on) is open source, the rest of the browser isn't |
| Offline translation feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | The Firefox Translations addon (WIP) allows offline translation, without relying on Google |
| Doesn't clutter Alt+Tab dialog with browser tabs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | This is annoying, and the setting to disable it is misleadingly in Windows' settings, not in Edge's settings (To disable, "Choose what windows appear when pressing Alt+Tab" > "Pressing Alt+Tab shows" - Select "Open Windows Only") |
| Community to request features | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Vote for, comment and suggest new features here: https://connect.mozilla.org  |
| Total cookie protection | ✅ | ❌ |❌ | https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/ | Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down to scroll to top/bottom of page | ✅| ⛔| ⛔ | Could be useful for people hard to use or non-existent Home/End keys |
| Re-open closed browser windows | ✅ | | ❌ | Use Ctrl+Shift+N. Note: in Edge, while you can re-open the site from the previously closed window, itopens in your current window instead |
| Re-open a closed Private/incognito tab | ✅ | ❔ | ❌ | This can be achieved by the standard Ctrl+Shift+T in Firefox |
| Ability to disable DRM | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | |
| Blocks CNAME cloaking | ✅ | ❌ | ❔| https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html |
| Removes tracking parameters from URLs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| As of version 102, Firefox removes parameters from URLs automatically when these may be used to identify and track users. |
| Advanced JSON viewing | ✅ | ❌| ❌ | Edge and Chrome only show very basic info, eg ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366232-929dde78-d5b0-4145-a964-f95fbd059762.png) compared to Firefox: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366305-ffd45712-69a3-4e95-951e-602529f34482.png) |
| Better font/Image rendering* | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Down-scaled images are blurrier in Chromium browsers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37906602/blurry-downscaled-images-in-chrome . Anecdotetally, people mention that fonts are sharper in Firefox, although I don't have evidence to back this up |

| View source: shows the 'raw' HTML/CSS/JS as it was sent… and highlight syntax errors in red and describes what went wrong in the tooltip | ✅ | ? | ? | |
| Sidebar |  ✅ | ❌ |❌| | Firefox includes the Sidebar which allows you to browse bookmarks, history and synced tabs while viewing a webpage. |
| Address bar: always show 'www' |✅ | ❌ | ?| Some (crappy) sites don't work without www. Chrome hides this so it looks like a "different" URL |
| Address bar: hightlight top level domain | ✅ | ❌ | ✅| Chrome makes it harder to spot deceptive sites in the address bar  |
| Address bar: "Switch to tab" using Enter |✅ | ❌ | ❌ | If you hit Enter in Chrome/Edge, they open a new tab of one you already have open (otherwise you need to use the mouse |
| Smooth scrolling | ✅ | ? | ? | You can also customise the scroll behavior on about:config |
| Tor browser based on it |✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Tags in bookmarks, which makes more sense than using directories. | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to override system proxy | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox allows you to configure proxy settings independently of the limited Windows settings   |
| Access to a vast array of settings through about:config | ✅ | | | |
| Reader view available on mobile (Android) | ✅ | ?| ? | |
| "Switch to" option when opening a link in a new tab (Android) | ✅ | ❌ | ?| Chrome opens a new tab in the background but without any notification/option to view it immediately |
| Search for whole words (Ctrl+F) | ✅ | ❌ |❌| |
| Context menu: show extensions | ✅ | ? |❌| Edge doesn't always show ublock origin for example in context menu |
| Better SSL certificate viewer | ✅ | ❌ |❌| Firefox uses a modern, full page view that shows more info, and doesn't lock up the tab while you view the cert |
| Option to set image as desktop background |✅|❌ | ❔| |
| Choice of search engine for every search |✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you choose an alternative search engine from the address bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178210218-d55806cb-2641-4baf-8b7b-82b42893b682.png) |
| Add custom search engines while browsing |✅ | ❌ | ❌| Sites that implement OpenSearch can be added as a search engine by clicking the magnifying glass with green plus icon from the address bar or search bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224100-86108a71-0832-4110-aaf0-e7e3d935cf6a.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224266-bd67a94a-cec3-4e9d-86f8-fcf19987ca39.png) | 
| Search Bookmarks, Open Tabs and History from the address bar | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | In Firefox, type the ```*```, ```%``` or ```^``` symbols in the address bar to search your bookmarks, tabs and history |
| Themes: easily build your own | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Build themes [online](https://color.firefox.com/) or with the Firefox Color extension |
| Themes: utilise backgrounds/images | ✅ | ✅ |❌ | While Edge supports themes from the Chrome store, it only displays theme colours, no images |
| Themes: preview a theme without installing it  | ✅|❌|❌| |
| Themes: higher coverage/more customisable |✅|❌|❌| Firefox themes the main menu, and has many elements that can be themed |
| Themes: gallery/store is non-political |✅|❌|❌ | The Chrome web store is pushing political themes, instead of good themes (Edge shares Chrome's theme store) |
| Themes: override OS theme (eg dark/light) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | I can't find any way to manually set dark mode for Chrome, even with addons. Edge has this feature |
| Show/hide bookmark bar easily | ✅|❌|✅| Firefox and Edge let you use Ctrl+Shift+B or right click to toggle the bookmark bar. Chrome has no easy way to disable the bar (on a new tab, for example) |
| Doesn't start/run in background | ✅|✅ |  ❌| [Startup boost keeps Edge running in the background with minimal processes, so it will start more quickly when launched.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-help-with-startup-boost-ebef73ed-5c72-462f-8726-512782c5e442) |
| Highest number of extensions/add-ons | ✅ |❌ |❌ | Firefox has over half a million add-ons available! | 
| Doesn't link browsing history, usage data and locations to users | ✅|❌| ✅ | ["Unlike Safari, Edge and Firefox, Chrome says it links all harvested data to devices and individuals."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/) |
| Easy toolbar customisation |✅|❌|✅| Chrome doesn't allow you to customise the toolbar (at least not easily, like FF/Edge) |
| Extensive toolbar options | ✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you add more stuff to the toolbar, eg Zoom, Full Screen and Email Link. Zoom is very handy to have |
| Easily deploy settings |✅|❌|❌ | You can drop/edit a user.js file to set most Firefox settings. I can't find a good way to export/import Chrome/Edge settings (except GPO), as they use an indecipherable file for their settings |
| Doesn't try to log you into the browser by default |✅|❌|❌| I don't remember actively logging into Edge, but it's logged me in anyways |
| Browser account that's not tied to your digital identity |✅|❌|❌| Edge and Chrome tie your browser to your google/microsoft account and can be/is used for tracking/advertising. Kinda creepy. Firefox account is purely for syncing your data. |
| Built independently of Google's Chromium browser engine | ✅|❌|❌| |
| Highlight text without any popup menus | ✅| ? |❌|  |
| Addons - keyboard shortcut to access |  ✅| ? |❌|  |
| Facebook container addon |  ✅| ❌ |❌|  |
| Dedicated search field |  ✅| ❌ |❌|  |
| Autoscroll - option to disable |  ✅| ? |❌ | This prevents middle clicks (to open link in new tab) from accidentally scrolling the page wildly if you're not 100% accurate on clicking a link |
| Native Eyedropper/color picker | ✅| ❌ | ? | |
| Add-ons: Install extension in private mode | ✅| ? |❌ | |
| Add-ons: Install extension using keyboard | ✅| ? |❌ | Firefox allows you to use Alt+A |
| Add-ons: Easily allow addon to run in private mode | ✅| ? |❌ | Firefox asks you during install. Edge doesn't ask at all, you have to manually enable after the fact |
| Mute tabs easily |  ✅| ? |❌ | |
| Visit a site directly instead of searching for it | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | When typing a local FQDN (eg on a domain), Edge and Chrome require you to add the HTTPS:// or HTTP:// prefix otherwise they search the web. Firefox goes straight to the site |
| Mute individual tabs in one click | ✅|❌ | ? | Chrome can mute entire sites, but not tabs |
| Saved Logins: Monitor and notify of breached logins | ✅| ⚠ | ❌ | Firefox alerts you if one of your saved logins had their site breached. Chrome has this feature, but it's manual and you have to sign in with your google account |
| Saved Logins: Shows icons of sites | ✅ | ? | ❌ | Firefox makes it a bit easier to identify entries |
| Sync: use any email address | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Chrome and Edge require google and Microsoft accounts exclusively to sync your data |
| Extensions: more lenient towards addons |✅ |❌|❌| Addons like [removeddit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/removeddit) violates Chrome's web store policy, but not Firefox's addon store |
| Address bar: match history for partial words |✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Eg when typing a partial URL like "tube" instead of "youtube", Edge/Chrome does not return any matches from history and treats it like a new search. Firefox's address bar does wildcard searches and matches ANY part of a word |
| Welcome screen that's not hostile | ✅ |✅|❌| I've seen Edge's welcome screen where you have no way to close or even Alt+F4 it! |
| Notification Permissions - better UI | ✅ | ? |❌| Firefox allows you to search sites and remove all sites from sending notifications easily |
| Dark about:blank page | ✅ | ? |❌| |
| Add private/incognito browsing shortcut to taskbar | ✅ | ? |?| |
| Block cookie banners* | ✅ | ? | ❌ | [Firefox now clears these annoying cookie banners on your behalf. We’ll always hit "Reject all" if we have that option though in absence of a "Reject all" we’ll do what you’d do otherwise and hit "Accept all"](https://community.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/firefox-cookie-banner-handling/) |
| Find-as-you-type | ✅ | ❌ | ? | Hit ```/``` to enter quick find. Useful for quick searches will disappear after a few moments. |
| Quickly search for (and navigate) links |✅ | ❌ | ? | Hit ```'``` to search for links, and ```Tab``` or ```Enter``` to follow them |
| Better "Find" functionality | ✅| ❌ | ❌ | Firefox provides options like Highlight All, Match Case, Match Diactritics, Whole Words when using Find ```Ctrl```+```F``` |  
| Open APIs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | https://0x65.dev/blog/2019-12-17/why-we-forked-firefox-and-not-chromium.html |
| Against the use of idle detection API | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  "We are concerned about the user-surveillance, user-manipulation, and abuse of user resources potential of this API, despite the required 60 second mitigation. Additionally it seems to be an unnecessarily powerful approach for the motivating use-cases, which themselves are not even clear they are worth solving"  https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#idle-detection-api |
| Address bar - ```*``` indicator for suggested favourites in drop-down | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  Pretty sure Edge used to have this... When you start typing a URL, Edge/Chrome show suggestions (including from your favourites) but without the ```*``` indicator. Therefore you can't distinguish between your history/favourites from the address bar dropdown. |
| Context menu: "Bookmark link" option | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Weird one not to have. Vivaldi has it. Even IE has it! |
| Still supported on Windows 7/8/8.1/2012/2012R2 | ✅ | ❌ | 🟡 | Note that Edge will still get security patches (only) on these OSes til October 2023. IE is still supported as long as the OS is in support 😂 |

| 🆕 [Fanboy's Mobile Notifications list](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-mobile-notifications.txt) | Gets rid of "Open in App" annoyances | 

## Unnecessary Add-ons / Extensions

⚠ These extensions are either superseded, outdated, redundant, obsolete or even malicious - yet they're still being recommended online (even by Mozilla themselves!). Fake news!   ⚠

| Extension/Addon | Reason |
|-|-|
| Absolute Enable Right Click & Copy | You can bypass right-clicking restrictions by using Shift+Right Click | |
| Adblocker Ultimate / adblock / adblock plus / AdGuard AdBlocker / AdNauseum / AdBlocker for Youtube (or any non-uBlock Origin ad blocker) | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) is king. |
| Allow Right-Click  | You can bypass right-clicking restrictions by using Shift+Right Click | |
| Behind The Overlay / Behind The Overlay Revival | uBlock Origin's annoyances filter list sorts out most sites, otherwise you can use the uBlock Origin zapper |
| Bypass Paywalls Clean | This has been recently removed from the Addons store. You can use uBlock with the BPC filter above to replicate most functionality | |
| Cookie AutoDelete | This functionality is built-in to Firefox | 
| CanvasBlocker / Smart Referrer | Obsolete due to ```privacy.resistFingerprinting``` being enabled and hardening ```XOriginPolicy``` (among other such changes) | 
| Clear Cache | You can do this manually or even use Ctrl+F5 (or developer tools) to disable cache when loading a page | 
| Clear Browsing Data | Only useful if you need a button instead of going through about:preferences#privacy |
| ClearURLs | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) can do this especially when you enable Adguard URL tracking protection filter in ublock Origin and subscribe to [DandelionSprout's Legitimate URL Shortener](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt&title=DandelionSprout-URL-Shortener)  | 
| Consent-O-Matic | For most situations, using uBlock Origin with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing   | 
| Clear Browsing Data | Only useful if you need to constantly and easily delete your browsing data. Otherwise, just do this within Firefox | 
| [Cycle Last Used Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clut-cycle-last-used-tabs/) | Enable Firefox's native Ctrl+Tab MRU option instead  | 
| Decentraleyes | Discontinued, superseded by LocalCDN | NOTE: It's OK to use on Firefox Android until LocalCDN is approved  |
| Disable JavaScript | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) can do this |
| Disconnect | use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) covers most of its feature set | 
| Enhancer for YouTube | Firefox can block autoplay, and uBlock blocks YouTube ads | 
| FastForward | uBlock Origin can do this using the ```uBlock Filters - Annoyances``` and ```AdGuard Annoyances``` lists |
| FoxClocks | On Windows at least, you can natively add 2 additional clocks/timezones |
| Emoji addons | Most OSes can insert emojis natively, eg Win + . opens the emoji panel on Win10 and newer |
| Full Web Page Screenshots (FireShot) | The built-in screenshot tool should cover this | 
| GIPHY for Firefox | Most web platforms (or keyboard apps on mobile) have ways to insert GIFs. For example, Facebook Messenger and Outlook/Hotmail can do this | 
| Ghostery | uBlock Origin is more powerful and is open source unlike Ghostery. More reasons [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/72810m/ublock_origin_vs_ghostery_and_privacy_badger/)  |
| [History Cleaner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/history-cleaner/) | You can likely achieve the same functionality using Ctrl+Shift+H (Show all history) and going from there |
| Honey | Use at your own discretion. Note the warnings about privacy ["Beware: Honey invites users to install its custom filter list in uBO without warning how it broadly disables privacy-protecting filters in uBO; i.e. google-analytics, taboola, pixel trackers, and so on. Mind this broad undermining of privacy protection if you import Honey's list."](https://twitter.com/gorhill/status/1352651716265713665) |
| HTTPS Everywhere/Smart HTTPS | Firefox has a HTTPS-Only mode built-in |
| I don't care about cookies | [This has been acquired by Avast](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/whats-new/acquisition/) . For most situations, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing  | Mozilla is working on this too, and Cookie Banner Reduction is an option in Firefox for Android |
| I Still Don't Care About Cookies | For most situations, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing | Mozilla is working on this too, and Cookie Banner Reduction is an option in Firefox for Android |
| NanoDefender| Discontinued, and can conflict with uBlock Origin |
| NoScript Security Suite | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.o  rg/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| PDF print/save/edit addons/Adobe | Most OSes can save as (aka Print to) PDF. Firefox also supports basic PDF editing nowadays | 
| Privacy Badger | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead. Firefox also blocks many trackers | 
| Tranquility Reader | Use Firefox's Reader Mode instead |
| YouTube downloaders | youtube-dlp is better (although it's a separate application and requires some tinkering) |
| Undo Close Tab | You can use Ctrl+Shift+T (or History, Recently Closed Tabs) instead |
| Tab Session Manager | Firefox should be able to do most or all of what this does natively |
| [Unhook: Remove YouTube Recommended Videos Comments](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/) | With minimal skills, you can achieve the same results with uBlock Origin  | 
| Simple Translate | Try [Firefox Translations](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/) first |
| uMatrix | [Archived by developer](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| Zoom Page WE | Probably/unlikely needed anymore |

# Tips / Tricks

### The address bar/awesome bar
- Use Alt+D or Ctrl+L to focus the address bar
  Type '*' in the address bar to limit results to your bookmarks
  Type '^' in the address bar to limit results to your history
  Type '%' in the address bar to limit results to your open tabs

### Others
- Disable sites from hijacking the right click menu (WIP)
- Force a crash using this tool:
- If you bookmark and tag a page you want to get back to, all you have to do is type * in the address (URL bar), followed by a tag, and it'll 'suggest' the sites that share that tag. 
- How to highlight/select linked text or part of a table

## Recommended settings

Settings that I configure from the get go

| Setting | Recommendation | Comment |
|-|-|-|
| Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order | Enable |
| Use autoscrolling | Disable (general.autoScroll = false)| This prevents mis-middle clicks that start scrolling the page instead of opening a tab in a new window |
| Confirm before closing multiple tabs | Enable | Ctrl+Q and Ctrl+Shift+W close the browser without any warning or prompts. This setting re-enables the prompt that Mozilla recently turned off: https://www.ghacks.net/2021/10/28/firefox-wont-prompt-anymore-when-you-are-closing-multiple-tabs-but-there-is-an-option-to-enable-it/ )
| Open previous windows and tabs | Enable |  |
| Enable Picture-In-Picture video controls | Enable | |
| Recommend extensions as you browse | Disable (browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.addons = false) | |
| Recommend features as you browse | Disable (browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.features = false) | |
| intl.regional_prefs.use_os_locales | true | Use your operating system settings for \<your locale\> to format dates, times, numbers and measurements |
| devtools.accessibility.enabled | false | This removes the "Inspect Accessibility Properties" context menu item (does anyone actually use this??) |
| browser.download.alwaysOpenPanel | false | Stops the Downloads panel opening every time a download finishes |
| apz.autoscroll.enabled | true | (Nightly only) enables elastic overscroll effect for touchpad/touchscreen |
| extensions.pocket.enabled | false | Disable pocket |
| browser.urlbar.suggest.topsites | false |  |
| browser.urlbar.sponsoredTopSites | false | |
| browser.urlbar.maxRichResults | <a number greater than 10> | This allows the address bar drop down to show more than 10 rows. 22 seems a good number |
| browser.urlbar.showSearchSuggestionsFirst | false | prioritises history and bookmarks instead of search results in the address bar |
| cookiebanners.service.mode  | 2 | Cookie banners handling |
| cookiebanners.service.mode.privateBrowsing | 2 | Cookie banners handling |

# Keyboard shortcuts

| Function | Key | |
|-|-|-|
| Re-open closed tab | Ctrl+Shift+T | |
| Move tab along tab strip | Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/PgDn | |
| Focus address bar | Alt+D||
| Focus search bar | Ctrl+K |
| Close tab | Ctrl+W | |
| Dev Tools: Network Tab | Ctrl+Shift+E |
| Remove an address from the address bar | Shift + Delete | If an address still appears after this, go to about:support, Places database, Verify Integrity, then restart Firefox |
| Switch to next/previous tab | Ctr+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab | | 
| Go to Addons | Ctrl+Shift+A | |  



# Internal pages

| Page | Info | Comment|
|-|-|-|
|about:crashes | | |
| about:cache | | |
| about:memory | | |
| about:telemetry | | 
| about:protections | | See how many social media trackers, cross-site tracking cookies, fingerprinters and cryptominers Firefox has blocked |
| about:performance |  | Useful for seeing which tabs are misbehaving and chewing up too much RAM/CPU |
| about:networking | | I use this to view/clear the DNS cache, do a basic DNS lookup and see DNS server config |
