## Why use Firefox?


Features that are unique to Firefox... or better than the big boys

| Feature | Firefox | Chrome | Edge | Comment |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Subtitles in Picture-in-Picture | ✅ | ❔ | ❔ |
| Multi Account Containers | ✅| ⛔| ⛔| While some hacks/workarounds exist, none work as well as Firefox's! | 
| Ctrl+Tab MRU tab switcher | ✅ |⛔| ⛔ | Killer feature! This option means users can Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab between their recent tabs, instead of switching to to the next tab (like Alt+Tab/Cmd+Tab) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/168515810-84a75560-62ac-441e-be99-b539fe0966c2.png) |
| Reader View | ✅ | ⛔ |⛔| A feature that strips away clutter like buttons, ads, background images, and videos while also letting you customize the layout and theme to fit your reading preferences. It can sometimes bypass paywalls! |
| Multiple Picture-in-Picture | ✅ |❔| ❔| |
| Video autoplay control | ✅ | ❔| ❔| Blocks many videos from auto-playing by default |
| uBlock Origin: best experience | ✅ | ⛔| ⛔| https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox |
| Ability to disable search engine suggestions | ✅ | | ⛔| Sorry, I don't want my browser trying to read my mind, and I don't want my keystrokes to be harvested either! |
| Open dev tools immediately using F12 | ✅ | | | Edge asks for confirmation first! |
| Vertical tabs/Tree Style Tabs | ✅ | ⛔ | ✅ | Edge has this built-in, but without any heirachy like Tree Style Tabs. Half a point to Edge! | 
| Enhanced Tracking Protection | ✅ | | |
| Developer Tools: pop out into a separate window | ✅ |⛔ | ⛔| |
| Developer Tools: show Network tab by default | ✅ | ⛔|⛔| What are the big boys trying to hide?? |
| Developer Tools: select multiple categories, eg Font and Img | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| Accelerator key for Inspect Element (Q) | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ | Minor, but why not have it? |
| SSL/certificate/HTTPS issues can be permanently excepted/stored |✅ | ⛔| ⛔| On Chrome you have to choose Advanced, then Proceed each time.|
| Copy hyperlinked text using Alt + Left click | ✅ | | | In Edge, the only way to do this is by Inspecting Element |
| Circumvent sites that block right-clicking by holding Ctrl + right click | ✅ | |||
| Dev Tools - show the domain in Network tab by default  | ✅|⛔|⛔| What are they trying to hide??|
| Show hyperlink URL immediately on hover | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | You have to hover for a few seconds in Edge|
| Video autoplay control | ✅ | ❔ | ❔ |
| Simple homepage config | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔| Seriously Edge, how do I turn off all the junk?? |
| uBlock Origin extension available on mobile | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔|
| Keyboard shortcut for Dev Tools: Network tab | ✅ | ❔| ❔| |
| Send tab to other device function | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to use your own sync server | ✅ | ⛔| ⛔| 
| Blocks cryptominers by default | ✅ | ❔| ❔| |
| Extensive customisation (eg userChrome.css) | ✅ | ❔ | ❔|
| Multiple dictionary (spell checker) support | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| Extensions/Add-ons on mobile | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔ |
| Easy on RAM* | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔ | I don't have hard evidence for this (yet) but the memes indicate that Chrome has an appetite for RAM |
| Supports blocking WebRequests in Manifest v3 | ✅ |⛔ | ❔ | One of the most controversial changes of Chrome’s MV3 approach is the removal of blocking WebRequest, which provides a level of power and flexibility that is critical to enabling advanced privacy and content blocking features. Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome’s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.|
| Android: play media in background/with screen off | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ | Firefox allows background media playback! You can listen to a youtube video with the screen off! | 
| Screenshot tool built in | ✅ | ⛔ | ✅| Really shouldn't need this, but on Windows the Snipping Tool and Snip & Sketch apps suck |
| Open source | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ | While Chromium (the engine Chrome and Edge are based on) is open source, the rest of the browser isn;t |
| Offline translation feature* | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ | Mozilla are working on this |
| Doesn't clutter Alt+Tab dialog with browser tabs | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | This is annoying, and has to be disabled in Windows' settings, not in browser settings |
| Community to request features | ✅ | ⛔| ⛔| https://connect.mozilla.org  |
| Dev tools inspector: Search bar | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | Edge is awkward about searching html |
| Total cookie protection | ✅ | ⛔ |⛔ | https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/ | Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down to scroll to top/bottom of page | ✅| ⛔| ⛔ | Could be useful for people hard to use or non-existent Home/End keys |
| Re-open a closed Windows | ✅ | | ⛔ | Use Ctrl+Shift+N. Note: in Edge, while you can re-open the site from the previously closed window, itopens in your current window instead |
| Re-open a closed Private/incognito tab | ✅ | ❔ | ⛔ | This can be achieved by the standard Ctrl+Shift+T |
| Ability to disable DRM | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔ | |
| Blocks CNAME cloaking | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔| | https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html |

- Customisation - you can drop/edit a user.js file to change most settings. I can't find a good way to export/import Edge settings (except GPO)
- The only major browser that's NOT built on Google's chromium codebase (besides Safari on iOS/OSX)


# Recommended Add-Ons / Extensions

Because googling for extensions is a minefield of useless, outdated and inaccurate recommendations. 

| Essential? | Icon | Name/Link | What | Why | Tips |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| | | [Imagus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imagus/) | Enlarge thumbnails, and show images/videos from links with a mouse hover. | | Set to enabled when holding Ctrl (otherwise it gets annoying by enlarging everything you hover over) | |

| | | [FeedBro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/) | Advanced Feed Reader - Read news & blogs or any RSS/Atom/RDF source. | | Handy for reading twitter feeds, and even can be setup to alert on keywords/new posts |
| | | [Tab Count Icon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-count-icon/) | Shows number of open tabs on the toolbar | | Tried a few of these, this one seems best. Easy to read and it can be set to any colour. |
| | | [QR](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/qr/) | Generates a QR code for the current page |
|✅ | | [Everything Metric](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/everything-metric-converter/) | Converts yankee/imperial units to metric! |
| | | [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) | | There's so many dark mode add-ons and they all have pros and cons. This one's a good all-rounder |
| | <img src="https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-64.png" width="20"> | [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)| Easily skip YouTube video sponsors. When you visit a YouTube video, the extension will check the database for reported sponsors and automatically skip known sponsors. You can also report sponsors in videos. | |
| | | [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) | Show tabs like a tree. | I disable animation effects and turn off Tree Behaviour > "When a new tree appears, collapse others automatically" and "When a tab gets focus, expand its tree and collapse others automatically" |
| | | [WebMail Ad blocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webmail-ad-blocker/) | Remove advertising clutter from  web-based email. Expand viewable area by blocking and removing ads on the right-hand side of the screen when using Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo Mail. |
| | | [Link Status Redux](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-status-redux/) | Shows an indicator on a popup panel next to the link address when the mouse cursor is over a link to a page you have bookmarked or visited before, or if the link is currently open in a browser tab. |
| | | [Linkificator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkificator/) | Converts text links into clickable hyperlinks | Handy for forums that don't allow proper links | Recommend setting this to On Demand, as it can slow down browsing and isn't often required. |

| ✅ | | [Bypass Twitter login](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-without-logging-in/) | Get around Twitter's login modal and still scroll tweets. This extension will add a button to your toolbar. When Twitter throws up a login wall, press the button and you'll be able to continue browsing. |

## Recommended uBlock filters

View your uBlock filters here: moz-extension://9ef2f22a-45d0-48fd-b0b3-5a47fd2b1a02/dashboard.html#3p-filters.html

- [uBlock Origin Dev Filter](https://github.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter) : Filters to block and remove copycat-websites from DuckDuckGo, Google and other search engines. Used to be specific to dev websites like StackOverflow or GitHub, but it currently supports others like Wikipedia.
- EasyList Cookie: gets rid of cookie alerts/popups. Also saves having to install other addons (like "I don't care about cookies"). Enable it in uBlock filter settings:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/169625772-208d3b1b-cb0b-45fb-920c-3df1d1f7b689.png)

- [Legitimate URL Shortener](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt&title=DandelionSprout-URL-Shortener): Removes junk and tracking parameters from URLs. Gets rid of Google AMP links, UTM parameters etc.

## Add-ons / Extensions you may NOT/should NOT be using

These extensions are either superseded, outdated, unnecessary or even malicious - yet they're still being recommended online.


| Extension | Reason | Comment |
|-|-|-|
| Decentraleyes | Discontinued, superseded by LocalCDN | We're all patiently waiting for LocalCDN to be approved for use in Firefox Android |
| Ghostery | uBlock Origin should take care of this | |
| ublock/adblock/adblock plus | Use uBlock Origin for content/ad blocking. Anything else pales in comparison.  |  |
| I don't care about cookies | For most situations, using uBlock Origin with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the job* | |
| uMatrix | Archived by developer (https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) | Use uBlock Origin instead |
| Privacy Badger | Use uBlock Origin instead | |

# Tips / Tricks

- If you start your search with ^ it will restrict suggestions to your history
- Typing % in the address bar will search open tabs
- Disable sites from hijacking the right click menu (WIP)
- Force a crash using this tool:
- If you bookmark and tag a page you want to get back to, all you have to do is type * in the address (URL bar), followed by a tag, and it'll 'suggest' the sites that share that tag. 
- How to highlight/select linked text or part of a table

## Recommended settings

Why aren't these on by default!?

- Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order
- Confirm before closing multiple tabs (Mozilla disabled this recently: https://www.ghacks.net/2021/10/28/firefox-wont-prompt-anymore-when-you-are-closing-multiple-tabs-but-there-is-an-option-to-enable-it/ )
- Open previous windows and tabs

# userChrome.css

Use this if you want to customise Firefox, eg by hiding the tab strip

## Enable use of userChrome.css

- Enable in about:config by setting ``toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`` to ``true``
- Open your Firefox profile folder (go to about:support > Profile Folder > Open Folder
- Create new folder "chrome" in your profile
- Create new file userChrome.css in your profile's chrome folder
- Edit the userChrome.css file with tweaks
- Restart Firefox

## userChrome.css tweaks
