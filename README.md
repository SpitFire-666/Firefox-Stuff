## Firefox is better...

Features that are unique to Firefox... or better than the big boys

| Feature | Firefox | Chrome | Edge | Comment |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Picture-in-Picture button | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | In Chrome, you have to right click the video twice to reveal the Picture-in-Picture option |  
| Subtitles in Picture-in-Picture | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | |

| Multiple Picture-in-Picture allowed | ✅ |❌| ❌ |  |
| Multi Account Containers | ✅| ❌| ❌| Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple accounts. While some addons/hacks/workarounds exist for Edge/Chrome, none work as well as Firefox's! | 
| Ctrl+Tab MRU tab switcher | ✅ |❌| ❌ | Allows you to use Ctrl+Tab to switch tabs in most recently used order (MRU) like Alt+Tab/Cmd+Tab in Windows/Mac. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn can still be used to go next/previous tab too!  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/168515810-84a75560-62ac-441e-be99-b539fe0966c2.png) |
| Reader View | ✅ | ❌ |❌| A feature that strips away clutter like buttons, ads, background images, and videos while also letting you customize the layout and theme to fit your reading preferences. It can sometimes bypass paywalls! |
| Blocks videos from playing automatically | ✅ | ❔| ❔| Blocks many videos from auto-playing by default |
| uBlock Origin: works best | ✅ | ⛔| ⛔| https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox |
| Open dev tools immediately using F12 | ✅ | | | Edge asks for confirmation first! |
| Vertical tabs/Tree Style Tabs | ✅ | ⛔ | ✅ | Edge has this built-in, but without any heirachy like Tree Style Tabs. Half a point to Edge! | 
| Enhanced Tracking Protection | ✅ | | |
| Developer Tools: pop out into a separate window | ✅ |⛔ | ⛔| |
| Developer Tools: show Network tab by default | ✅ | ⛔|⛔| What are the big boys trying to hide?? |
| Developer Tools: select multiple categories, eg Font and Img | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| Accelerator key for Inspect Element (Q) | ✅ | ⛔ | ⛔ | Minor, but why not have it? |
| SSL/certificate/HTTPS issues can be permanently excepted/stored |✅ | ⛔| ⛔| On Chrome you have to choose Advanced, then Proceed each time.|
| Copy hyperlinked text using Alt + Left click | ✅ | | | In Edge, the only way to do this is by Inspecting Element |
| Circumvent sites that block right-clicking by holding Ctrl + right click | ✅ | |||
| Dev Tools - show the domain in Network tab by default  | ✅|⛔|⛔| What are they trying to hide??|
| Show hyperlink URL immediately on hover | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | You have to hover over the link for a few seconds in Edge|
| Video autoplay control | ✅ | ❔ | ❔ |
| Simple homepage config | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔| Seriously Edge, how do I turn off all the junk?? |
| uBlock Origin extension available on mobile | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔|
| Keyboard shortcut for Dev Tools: Network tab | ✅ | ❔| ❔| |
| Send tab to other device function | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to use your own sync server | ✅ | ⛔| ⛔| 
| Blocks cryptominers by default | ✅ | ❔| ❔| |
| Extensive customisation (eg userChrome.css) | ✅ | ❔ | ❔| |
| Multiple dictionary (spell checker) support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌||
| Extensions/Add-ons on mobile | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  |
| Easy on RAM/CPU* | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | I don't have hard evidence for this (yet) but the memes indicate that Chrome has an appetite for RAM |
| Allows blocking WebRequests in Manifest v3 | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | One of the most controversial changes of Chrome’s MV3 approach is the removal of blocking WebRequest, which provides a level of power and flexibility that is critical to enabling advanced privacy and content blocking features. Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome’s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.|
| Android: Background media play | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Firefox allows you to listen to a videos in the background or with the screen off! | 
| Screenshot tool built in | ✅ | ❌ | ✅| Really shouldn't need this, but on Windows the Snipping Tool and Snip & Sketch apps suck |
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | While Chromium (the engine Chrome and Edge are based on) is open source, the rest of the browser isn;t |
| Offline translation feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | The Firefox Translations addon (WIP) allows offline translation, without relying on Google |
| Doesn't clutter Alt+Tab dialog with browser tabs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | This is annoying, and the setting to disable it is misleadingly in Windows' settings, not in Edge's settings (To disable, "Choose what windows appear when pressing Alt+Tab" > "Pressing Alt+Tab shows" - Select "Open Windows Only") |
| Community to request features | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Vote for, comment and suggest new features here: https://connect.mozilla.org  |
| Dev tools inspector: Search bar | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | Edge is awkward about searching HTML |
| Total cookie protection | ✅ | ⛔ |⛔ | https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/ | Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down to scroll to top/bottom of page | ✅| ⛔| ⛔ | Could be useful for people hard to use or non-existent Home/End keys |
| Re-open closed browser windows | ✅ | | ❌ | Use Ctrl+Shift+N. Note: in Edge, while you can re-open the site from the previously closed window, itopens in your current window instead |
| Re-open a closed Private/incognito tab | ✅ | ❔ | ❌ | This can be achieved by the standard Ctrl+Shift+T |
| Ability to disable DRM | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔ | |
| Blocks CNAME cloaking | ✅ | ⛔ | ❔| | https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html |
| Removes tracking parameters from URLs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| As of version 102, Firefox removes parameters from URLs automatically when these may be used to identify and track users. |
| Advanced JSON viewing | ✅ | ❌| ❌ | Edge and Chrome only show very basic info, eg ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366232-929dde78-d5b0-4145-a964-f95fbd059762.png) compared to Firefox: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366305-ffd45712-69a3-4e95-951e-602529f34482.png) |
| Better font/Image rendering* | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Down-scaled images are blurrier in Chromium browsers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37906602/blurry-downscaled-images-in-chrome . Anecdotetally, people mention that fonts are sharper in Firefox, although I don't have evidence to back this up |
| Able to run portably/from USB | ✅ | | | |
| "View page source" available in context menu | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Address bar at bottom (Android) | ✅ | ? | ? | Address bar can be set to top or bottom |
| HTML table subsections selection / Select HTML tables by column | ✅|❌ |❌ | In Firefox, Ctrl+Click to select multiple cells of a table| 
| Easily opt out of telemetry | ✅| | | |
| Incognito/Private mode that doesn't track you | ✅ | ❌| | Source: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-chrome-incognito-mode-privacy |
| Can place bookmarks on the address bar | ✅ | ❔| ❔| |
| View source shows the “raw” HTML/CSS/JS as it was sent… and nicely highlights syntax errors in red and describes what went wrong in the tooltip. | ✅ | ? | ? | |
| Smooth scrolling | ✅ | ? | ? | and you can customise the behavior on about:config |
| Tor browser based on it |✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Tags in bookmarks, which makes more sense than using directories. | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to override system proxy | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox allows you to configure proxy settings independently of the limited Windows settings   |
| Access to a vast array of settings through about:config | ✅ | | | |
| Reader view available on mobile (Android) | ✅ | ?| ? ||
| Search for whole words (Ctrl+F) | ✅ | ❌ |❌| |
| Better SSL certificate viewer | ✅ | ❌ |❌| Edge and Chrome use the standard clunky Windows certificate dialog, making it difficult to view, copy/paste etc. Firefox uses a modern, full page view that doesn't block the entire browser (if you view a cert in Edge/Chrome, the whole browser is locked up until you close the cert)|
| Option to set image as desktop background |✅|❌ | ❔| |
| Choice of search engine for every search |✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you choose an alternative search engine from the address bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178210218-d55806cb-2641-4baf-8b7b-82b42893b682.png) |
| Add custom search engines while browsing |✅ | ❌ | ❌| Sites that implement OpenSearch can be added as a search engine by clicking the magnifying glass with green plus icon from the address bar or search bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224100-86108a71-0832-4110-aaf0-e7e3d935cf6a.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224266-bd67a94a-cec3-4e9d-86f8-fcf19987ca39.png) | 
| Search Bookmarks, Open Tabs and History from the address bar | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | In Firefox, type the ```*```, ```%``` or ```^``` symbols in the address bar to search your bookmarks, tabs and history |
| Themes: easily build your own | ✅ | ❌| ❌| |
| Themes: preview a theme without installing it  | ✅|❌|❌| |
| Themes: higher coverage/more customisable |✅|❌|❌| Firefox themes the main menu, and has many elements that can be themed |
| Themes: gallery/store is non-political |✅|❌|❌ | The Chrome web store pushing political themes, instead of good themes (Edge shares Chrome's theme store) |
| Show/hide bookmark bar easily | ✅|❌|✅| Firefox and Edge let you use Ctrl+Shift+B or right click to toggle the bookmark bar. Chrome has no easy way to disable the bar (on a new tab, for example)|
| Doesn't start/run in background | ✅| ❌| ✅ | [Startup boost keeps Edge running in the background with minimal processes, so it will start more quickly when launched.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-help-with-startup-boost-ebef73ed-5c72-462f-8726-512782c5e442) |
| Highest number of extensions/add-ons | ✅ |❌ |❌ | Firefox has over half a million add-ons available! | 
| Doesn't link browsing history, usage data and locations to users | ✅|❌| ✅ | ["Unlike Safari, Edge and Firefox, Chrome says it links all harvested data to devices and individuals."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/) |
| "Do not track" setting by default | ✅|❌|❌ | |
| Easy toolbar customisation |✅|❌|✅| Chrome doesn't allow you to customise the toolbar (at least not easily, like FF/Edge) |
| Extensive toolbar options | ✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you add more stuff to the toolbar, eg Zoom, Full Screen and Email Link. Zoom is very handy to have |

- Customisation - you can drop/edit a user.js file to change most settings. I can't find a good way to export/import Edge settings (except GPO)
- The only major browser that's NOT built on Google's chromium codebase (besides Safari on iOS/OSX)

|✅ | | [Everything Metric](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/everything-metric-converter/) | Converts yankee/imperial units to metric! |
| | | [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) | | There's so many dark mode add-ons and they all have pros and cons. This one's a good all-rounder |
| | <img src="https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-64.png" width="20"> | [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)| Easily skip YouTube video sponsors.

| | | [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) | Show tabs like a tree. | I disable animation effects and turn off Tree Behaviour > "When a new tree appears, collapse others automatically" and "When a tab gets focus, expand its tree and collapse others automatically" |

| | | [Link Status Redux](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-status-redux/) | Shows an indicator on a popup panel next to the link address when the mouse cursor is over a link to a page you have bookmarked or visited before, or if the link is currently open in a browser tab. |
| | | [Linkificator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkificator/) | Converts text links into clickable hyperlinks | Handy for forums that don't allow proper links | Recommend setting this to On Demand, as it can slow down browsing and isn't often required. |

| | | [LibRedirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/libredirect/) | Redirects Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and more to privacy friendly alternatives. | This is a bit hit and miss for me, but if you're hardcore about privacy it's worth trying |

| | | [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-clean) | Read articles from websites that implement a paywall.

## Recommended uBlock filters

View your uBlock filters here: moz-extension://9ef2f22a-45d0-48fd-b0b3-5a47fd2b1a02/dashboard.html#3p-filters.html

- [uBlock Origin Dev Filter](https://github.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter) : Filters to block and remove copycat-websites from DuckDuckGo, Google and other search engines. Used to be specific to dev websites like StackOverflow or GitHub, but it currently supports others like Wikipedia.
- EasyList Cookie: gets rid of cookie alerts/popups. Also saves having to install other addons (like "I don't care about cookies"). Enable it in uBlock filter settings:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/169625772-208d3b1b-cb0b-45fb-920c-3df1d1f7b689.png)

- [Legitimate URL Shortener](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt&title=DandelionSprout-URL-Shortener): Removes junk and tracking parameters from URLs. Gets rid of Google AMP links, UTM parameters etc.

## Add-ons / Extensions you can remove/replace

These extensions are either superseded, outdated, unnecessary or even malicious - yet they're still being recommended online.

| Extension | Reason | Comment |
|-|-|-|
| Decentraleyes | Discontinued, superseded by LocalCDN | We're all patiently waiting for LocalCDN to be approved for use in Firefox Android |
| Ghostery | uBlock Origin should take care of this | |
| ublock/adblock/adblock plus | uBlock Origin is king.  |  |
| I don't care about cookies | For most situations, using uBlock Origin with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the job* | |
| uMatrix | Archived by developer (https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) | Use uBlock Origin instead |
| Privacy Badger | Use uBlock Origin instead | |
| Tranquility Reader | Use Firefox's Reader Mode instead | |
| Full Web Page Screenshots (FireShot) | The built-in screenshot tool should cover this | | 
| HTTPS Everywhere | Firefox has a HTTPS-Only mode built-in| |

## Recommended settings

Settings that I configure from the get go

| Setting | Recommendation | Comment |
|-|-|-|
| Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order | Enable |
| Use autoscrolling | Disable (general.autoScroll = false)| This prevents mis-middle clicks that start scrolling the page instead of opening a tab in a new window |
| Confirm before closing multiple tabs | Enable | Ctrl+Q and Ctrl+Shift+W close the browser without any warning or prompts. This setting re-enables the prompt that Mozilla recently turned off: https://www.ghacks.net/2021/10/28/firefox-wont-prompt-anymore-when-you-are-closing-multiple-tabs-but-there-is-an-option-to-enable-it/ )
| Open previous windows and tabs | Enable |  |
| Enable Picture-In-Picture video controls | Enable | |
| Recommend extensions as you browse | Disable (browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.addons = false) | |
| Recommend features as you browse | Disable (browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.features = false) | |
| Use your operating system settings for <your locale> to format dates, times, numbers and measurements | Enable | |
| devtools.accessibility.enabled | false | This removes the "Inspect Accessibility Properties" context menu item (does anyone actually use this??) |
| browser.download.alwaysOpenPanel | false | Stops the Downloads panel opening every time a download finishes |
| apz.autoscroll.enabled | true | (Nightly only) enables elastic overscroll effect for touchpad/touchscreen |
| extensions.pocket.enabled | false | Disable pocket |

# Keyboard shortcuts

| Function | Key | |
|-|-|-|
| Re-open closed tab | Ctrl+Shift+T | |
| Move tab along tab strip | Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/PgDn | |
| Focus address bar | Alt+D||
| Focus search bar | Ctrl+K |
| Close tab | Ctrl+W | |
| Dev Tools: Network Tab | Ctrl+Shift+E |
| Remove an address from the address bar | Shift + Delete | If an address still appears after this, go to about:support, Places database, Verify Integrity, then restart Firefox |
| Switch to next/previous tab | Ctr+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab | | 
| Go to Addons | Ctrl+Shift+A | |  



# Internal pages

| Page | Info | Comment|
|-|-|-|
|about:crashes | | |
| about:cache | | |
| about:memory | | |
| about:telemetry | | 
| about:protections | | See how many social media trackers, cross-site tracking cookies, fingerprinters and cryptominers Firefox has blocked |
| about:performance |  | Useful for seeing which tabs are misbehaving and chewing up too much RAM/CPU |
| about:networking | | I use this to view/clear the DNS cache, do a basic DNS lookup and see DNS server config |
